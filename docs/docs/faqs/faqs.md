## Installation error: invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist.
---
After running: `docker compose up`, if you get the error:

```
Error response from daemon: invalid mount config for type "bind":
bind source path does not exist: /tmp/seeker/dbt
```

This means you havenâ€™t set your `DBT_PROJECT_DIR`.

In your terminal, run the following (replacing the path with the path to your dbt project):

```
# Specify the path to your dbt project
# (i.e. the directory containing dbt_project.yml)
# You MUST use the absolute path (i.e no ../../myrepo)
export DBT_PROJECT_DIR=/Users/myuser/dbtrepo
```

## lightdash crashed! How can I find out what happened?
---
If you launched via `yarn start`:
1. Check the javascript console in your browser
  - Safari: `opt-cmd-c`

2. Check the terminal where you ran yarn start
  - Errors from the dbt server will show in json blobs with a "state": "ERROR" flag
  - Errors from the lightdash server are anything that doesn't look like a json blob

## Command "docker-compose" not found
---
When trying to launch lightdash, if you get a `docker-compose not found` error message, this is likely because the Docker app isn't running.

Docker needs to be running on your device before you can launch lightdash. To do this, just open the Docker app.
