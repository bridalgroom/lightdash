# SQL Variables

When writing SQL in your Lightdash models, you can use the following references to template you SQL and make it more
reusable

-   `${field}` - reference a field in the current model
-   `${model.field}` - reference a field in another model
-   `${TABLE}` - reference the current table's sql reference
-   `${lightdash.attributes.my_attr_1}` - a user attribute called `my_attr_1`
    -   (optional) `ld` as an alias for `lightdash`
    -   (optional) `attribute` or `attr` as an alias for `attributes`
