# The SQL Runner

The SQL runner is used to run ad-hoc queries or charts using totally custom SQL. Charts built using the SQL runner can be shared, but can't be saved to your saved charts or added to a dashboard.

## Building a query using the SQL runner

The SQL runner can be accessed from the `new` --> `Query using SQL runner` option in your navigation bar.
