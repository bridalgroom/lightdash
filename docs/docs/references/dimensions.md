# Dimensions

Dimensions are the columns in your table. They are the "attributes" of your data. For example, user_id in your users table is a dimension.

---

## Adding dimensions to your project

For a dimension to appear in Lightdash, you just need to declare it in your dbt model's YAML file.

```
version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: user_id # will be "User id" in LightDash
        description: 'Unique identifier for a user."
```

Column descriptions in your YAML file are automatically pulled into Lightdash and you can spot them if you hover over the dimension name ðŸ‘€

## Dimension types

Dimension types are automatically pulled from your tables schemas in Lightdash. We currently support these dimension types:

| Dimension Types |
| --------------- |
| String          |
| Number          |
| Timestamp       |
| Date            |
| Boolean         |
