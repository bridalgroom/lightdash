# Dimensions reference sheet

Dimensions are the columns in your table. They are the "attributes" of your data. For example, user_id in your users table is a dimension.

## Adding dimensions to your project

Read more about [adding dimensions to your project in our docs here](/guides/how-to-create-dimensions).

For a dimension to appear in Lightdash, you just need to declare it in your dbt model's YAML file.

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: user_id # will be "User id" in LightDash
        description: 'Unique identifier for a user."
```

Column descriptions in your YAML file are automatically pulled into Lightdash and you can spot them if you hover over the dimension name ðŸ‘€

## Dimension types

Dimension types are automatically pulled from your tables schemas in Lightdash. We currently support these dimension types:

| Dimension Types |
| --------------- |
| string          |
| number          |
| timestamp       |
| date            |
| boolean         |

## Dimension configuration

To customize the dimension, you can do it in your dbt model's YAML file.

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: revenue_gbp_total_est
        description: "Total estimated revenue in GBP based on forecasting done by the finance team."
        meta:
          dimension:
            label: 'Total revenue' # this is the label you'll see in Lightdash
            description: 'My custom description'
            sql: "IF(${revenue_gbp_total_est} = NULL, 0, ${registered_user_email})"
            hidden: false
            round: 2
            format: 'gbp'
```

All the properties you can customize:

If you set this property, this is what you'll see in Lightdash instead of the dimension name.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

You can use this to override the description you have for the dimension in dbt.                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Time intervals

Lightdash automatically adds intervals for dimensions that are timestamps or dates, so you don't have to!

For example, here we have the timestamp dimension `created` defined in our dbt project:

```yaml
      - name: created
        description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
```

Lightdash breaks this out into the default intervals automatically. So, this is how `created` appears in our Lightdash project:

![screenshot-default-intervals](assets/screenshot-default-intervals.png)

### By default, the time intervals we use are:

**Date**: ['DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'YEAR']
**Timestamp**: ['RAW', 'DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'YEAR']

### To change the time intervals used for a dimension, specify your custom intervals using `time_intervals`

If you want to change the time intervals shown for a dimension, you can specify the custom time intervals you'd like you include using the `time_intervals` property for a dimension. You can use any values supported by your warehouse. Here are the supported time intervals in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions#extract:~:text=FROM%20date_expression)-,Description,-Returns%20the%20value) and [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/year.html#usage-notes).

In this example, I've only included the day, month, and quarter time intervals for the `created` dimension in Lightdash.

```yaml
      - name: created
        description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            time_intervals:
              - DAY
              - MONTH
              - QUARTER
```

![screenshot-custom-intervals](assets/screenshot-custom-intervals.png)

### To turn off time intervals for a dimension, set `time_intervals: OFF`

If you want to turn off time intervals for a dimension, you can simply set the `time_intervals` property to `OFF`.

In this example, `created` would now appear as a single, timestamp dimension without a drop-down list of time intervals in Lightdash:

```yaml
      - name: created
        description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            time_intervals: OFF
```
