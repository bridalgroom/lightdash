# Dimensions reference sheet

Dimensions are the columns in your table. They are the "attributes" of your data. For example, `user_id` in your users table is a dimension.

Dimensions match 1:1 with columns in your dbt models.

---

## Adding dimensions to your project

Read more about [adding dimensions to your project in our docs here](/guides/how-to-create-dimensions).

For a dimension to appear in Lightdash, you just need to declare it in your dbt model's YAML file.

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: user_id # will be "User id" in LightDash
        description: 'Unique identifier for a user."
```

Column descriptions in your YAML file are automatically pulled into Lightdash and you can spot them if you hover over the dimension name ðŸ‘€

## Dimension types

Dimension types are automatically pulled from your tables schemas in Lightdash. We currently support these dimension types:

| Dimension Types |
| --------------- |
| string          |
| number          |
| timestamp       |
| date            |
| boolean         |

## Dimension configuration

To customize the dimension, you can do it in your dbt model's YAML file.

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: revenue_gbp_total_est
        description: "Total estimated revenue in GBP based on forecasting done by the finance team."
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
            label: 'Total revenue' # this is the label you'll see in Lightdash
            description: 'My custom description' # you can override the description you'll see in Lightdash here
            sql: "IF(${revenue_gbp_total_est} = NULL, 0, ${registered_user_email})" # custom SQL applied to the column from dbt used to define the dimension
            hidden: false
            round: 2
            format: 'gbp'
            group_label: "Revenue"
      - name: forecast_date
        description: "Date of the forecasting."
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: date
            time_intervals: ['DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'QUARTER'] # not required: the default time intervals for dates are `['DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'YEAR']`
            urls:
              - label: "Open in forecasting tool"
                url: "https://finance.com/forceasts/weeks/${ value.formatted }"
```

All the properties you can customize:

## Time intervals

Lightdash automatically adds intervals for dimensions that are timestamps or dates, so you don't have to!

For example, here we have the timestamp dimension `created` defined in our dbt project:

```yaml
      - name: created
        description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
```

Lightdash breaks this out into the default intervals automatically. So, this is how `created` appears in our Lightdash project:

![screenshot-default-intervals](assets/screenshot-default-intervals.png)

### By default, the time intervals we use are:

**Date**: ['DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'YEAR']
**Timestamp**: ['RAW', 'DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'YEAR']

### You can use any time interval value supported by your warehouse

Here are the supported time intervals in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions#extract:~:text=FROM%20date_expression)-,Description,-Returns%20the%20value) and [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/year.html#usage-notes).

### To change the time intervals used for a dimension, specify your custom intervals using `time_intervals`

If you want to change the time intervals shown for a dimension, you can specify the custom time intervals you'd like you include using the `time_intervals` property for a dimension.

In this example, I've only included the day, month, and quarter time intervals for the `created` dimension in Lightdash.

```yaml
      - name: created
        description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            time_intervals:
              - DAY
              - MONTH
              - QUARTER
```

![screenshot-custom-intervals](assets/screenshot-custom-intervals.png)

### To turn off time intervals for a dimension, set `time_intervals: OFF`

If you want to turn off time intervals for a dimension, you can simply set the `time_intervals` property to `OFF`.

In this example, `created` would now appear as a single, timestamp dimension without a drop-down list of time intervals in Lightdash:

```yaml
      - name: created
        description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            time_intervals: OFF
```

![screenshot-intervals-off](assets/screenshot-intervals-off.png)

## URLs

Lightdash users can interact with dimension values by clicking on them. By adding custom `urls` you can configure 
the actions available to your users. Like linking to external tools, or taking actions in other tools.

In the example below, users can click on a company name and open a corresponding record in their CRM or search for 
the company in google.

```yaml
columns:
  - name: company_name
    label: Registered trading name of the company
    meta:
      dimension: 
        urls:
          - label: Search for company in Google
            url: "https://google.com/search?${ value.formatted | url_encode }"
          - label: Open in CRM
            url: "https://mycrm.com/companies/${ value.formatted | url_encode }"
```

The `${ value.formatted }` will be replaced with the value of the company name in the Lightdash UI at query run time.

### Liquid Templating

Use templates to configure the url values depending on the query, this allows your urls to depend on the results of 
queries. 

**Available liquid tags**

| Tag                    | Description                                                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `${ value.formatted }` | The exact value of the dimension as seen in the Lightdash UI. For example "$1,427.20"        |
| `${ value.raw }`       | The raw value of the dimension returned from the underlying SQL query. For example "1427.2 " |

**Available liquid filters**

Filters can be used to make small transformations of your values:

| Filter     | Description                                                            | Example usage        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| url_encode | Encode a string as url safe, for example it replaces spaces with `%20` | `${value.formatted \ | url_encode }`|
| downcase   | Convert string to all lowercase                                        | `${value.formatted \ | downcase }`|
| append     | Append a string to another                                             | `${value.formatted \ | append: ".html"}`|

There are [many more filters available in the Liquid documentation](https://liquidjs.com/filters/overview.html).
