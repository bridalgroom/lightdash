# User Attributes

User attributes provide a way to customise Lightdash charts, dashboards, and other behaviour depending on the user 
that is logged in. For example, you could only show your sales team members data that are relevant to their region.

User attributes are defined for your whole Organization and can only be a text value (not a date or number). Some 
examples of user attributes are:

- Sales region
- Department
- Can view PII
- Can view financial data

To start user attributes you need to follow 2 steps:

1. Define the user attribute, users can only have user attributes that are explicitly created by admins
2. Set the user attribute value per user.

User attributes can only be managed by admins.

## Managing user attributes


### 1. Creating user attributes


User attributes can be created by navigating to **Organization Settings** > **User Attributes** and clicking on the 
**Add attribute** button. This will create a new user attribute but it will not be assigned to any user.

### 2. Assigning user attributes to users

User attributes can be assigned to users by navigating to **Organization Settings** > **User Attributes** and 
clicking on the user attribute you'd like to assign. Select a user by email address and set their value.

## Using user attributes in Lightdash

There are several places in Lightdash where you can customise behaviour based on user attributes.

When referencing user attributes in SQL you can use the following [SQL variables](./sql-variables.mdx):

- `${ lightdash.attributes.my_attr_1 }` - a user attribute called `my_attr_1`
  - (optional) `ld` as an alias for `lightdash`
  - (optional) `attribute` or `attr` as an alias for `attributes`

### 1. Row filtering with `sql_filter`

You can use user attributes to filter the rows returned by a query. This is useful if you want to restrict the data 
based on the user's attributes. To reference a user attribute in your sql, use the special lightdash reference 
`${ lightdash.attributes.<attribute_name> }`. For example, if you have a user attribute called `sales_region` you can
use it in your sql like this:

```yaml
models:
  - name: my_model
    meta:
      sql_filter: ${TABLE}.sales_region = ${ lightdash.attributes.sales_region }
```

### 2. Filtering joins with `sql_on`

If you're joining a table, you can also customise the rows that are returned 

You can use user attributes to filter the rows returned by a join. This is useful if you want to restrict the data 
returned from the joined table. To reference a user attribute in your sql, use the special lightdash reference 
`${ lightdash.attributes.<attribute_name> }`. For example, if you have a user attribute called `sales_region` you can
use it in your sql like this:

```yaml
models:
  - name: base
    meta:
      joins:
        - join: joined
          sql_on: >
            ${base}.id = ${joined}.id
            AND ${joined}.sales_region = ${ lightdash.attributes.sales_region }
```
