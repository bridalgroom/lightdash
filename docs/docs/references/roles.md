# Roles and permissions

* Everybody in your organization will join as an `Organization Member` by default unless specified.
* All organization members can create their own projects and will be the Project Admin for that project.

## Project Roles

Project Admins can invite users to their project and assign the following roles. Note that projects may also be 
accessible by users with organization roles.

## Organization Roles

Organization Admins can assign roles to organization members, which gives access to all projects in the organization.

## Space Roles

Space permissions are inherited from a user's project permissions. For example, if I'm a project viewer, I will get `viewer` access to a Space.
