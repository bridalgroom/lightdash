# Using Tables and the Explore view in Lightdash

Now that you've connected your dbt project to Lightdash, it's time to start exploring your data.

A **Table** is the main starting point for exploring data in Lightdash. It contains a group of related
dbt models, dimensions, and metrics. You **explore Tables in the Explore view**.

## Learn about the key components in Tables and how we explore them in the Explore view

[![tutorial exploring the explore view](./assets/tutorial_exploring_the_explore_view.png)](https://youtu.be/q6CAP4nhn4E)

There are 5 areas to the Explore view:

1. The list of metrics and dimensions available on the Table
2. The filters panel, which lets you restrict the data pulled into Lightdash
3. The chart panel to visualise the results of queries
4. The results panel to explore the results of queries as a table
5. The SQL panel, which shows the raw SQL that produced the results

## Learn how to create a saved chart from the Explore view

## Running your query

To run a query:

1. Select a metric to calculate
2. Select one or more dimensions to split the metric into groups
3. Hit "Run Query" in the top right

For example, if I wanted to know the "total number of orders split by order status", I'd select the `Unique order
count` metric to calculate the number of orders and the `Status` dimension to split that by status.

## Ordering the results in your table

Click on the table headers that you want to sort by and click again if you want to change from ascending to descending.
If you need multiple sorts you can add more by pressing `âŒƒ Control` or `âŒ˜ Command` and click on the table header.

## Visualising query results as a chart

Once the query executes, the results will show in the results table. You can then open the charts section and choose
a chart type to visualise the metric.

## View the underlying data in a cell

You can click on any cell in your results table and view the records from your table which make up that cell.

For example, I can click on the `page view count` in my results table here and I'd see all of the rows in my `Pages` table that make up my 32,880 count.

<img src={UnderlyingClick} width="656" height="224" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

<img src={UnderlyingResults} width="667" height="538" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

I can then export this as a CSV or explore from this underlying data.

## Saving a chart

Saved Charts allow you to save a specific chart or visualisation so you can share it or revisit it again in future.

When you open a saved charts, it will always update to display the latest data in your database.

![save chart button](./assets/save_chart_action.png)

To save a chart:

1. In chart panel of the Explore view you will find the button to save your chart.
2. Enter a memorable name for the chart, a good idea is to use a question as the name "How many orders are there at each stage?"
3. Click on `Saved charts` to see your finished work of art ðŸ˜šðŸ‘Œ
