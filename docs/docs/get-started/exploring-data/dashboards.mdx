# Creating Dashboards

Dashboards allow you to arrange multiple charts that are related to each other into a single view.

Checkout this tutorial on how to create your first dashboard:
[![tutorial building first dashboard](./assets/tutorial_building_first_dashboard.png)](https://youtu.be/olFcN8Pui08)

## 1. Create a new empty dashboard

On the nav bar, click "New" to create a new dashboard.

<img src={DashboardAddNew} width="438" height="250" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

Fill out the details of your new dashboard and hit 'Create'. Once done, you will be redirected to your new Dashboard page:

<img src={DashboardAddTileCenter} width="1119" height="622" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

Next, you'll want to add some tiles to your dashboard by clicking on the `add tile` button.

## 2. Choose a chart to add to your dashboard

You can either create a new chart from within your dashboard, or you can add an existing chart.

### How to create a chart from within your dashboard.

Charts that are created from within your dashboard are exclusive to the dashboard. This means that they can't be reused in other dashboards in your project. 

Creating charts from within a dashboard helps to keep your spaces and projects clutter-free from charts that are used only once in a dashboard. 

Click "Add tile" and then "New chart" to create a chart that is exclusive to the dashboard. You will be taken to the chart builder. Once you save the chart it will appear at the bottom of your dashboard.

Note: These charts can't be used in other dashboards and won't be shown in the global search or in any space. If you want to make these charts reusable in other dashboards, you can detatch them from the dashboard and save them to a space so they're permanent using the `move to space` option from the chart's three-dot-menu.

### How to add an existing chart to your dashboard. 

You can add an existing chart to your dashboard by clicking "Add tile" and then "Saved chart". Clicking any chart will add it at the bottom of your dashboard.

<img src={AddSavedChart} width="618" height="210" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

You can resize charts by dragging the lower-right corner.

You can position your chart by dragging the center of the chart.

## 3. Save and share your dashboard

When you're happy with the layout, hit "Save".

You can share your dashboard with anybody in your Lightdash organisation by copying the URL (or by pressing on the ðŸ”— button). 

You can also see all of the saved dashboards in your project by clicking on `Browse` --> `All Dashboards`.

<img src={AllDashboards} width="673" height="535" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>
