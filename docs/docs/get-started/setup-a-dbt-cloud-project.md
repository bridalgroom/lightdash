# Setup Lightdash to connect to your dbt cloud project

:::note Article deprecated

This article has been moved here: [Connect project](./setup-lightdash/connect-project.mdx)

:::

Lightdash can connect to a dbt Cloud, but we don't support connecting Lightdash
to [dbt Cloud managed repositories](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-using-a-managed-repository)
.
If you'd like to use Lightdash, you'll need to have a remote repository for your dbt project in one of the services we
support.
