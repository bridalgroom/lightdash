# Lightdash CLI

The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your dbt + Lightdash project. It makes development faster and 
easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash instance.

## Installation

To install Lightdash, you'll need to have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 
installed. Mac/Linux users usually already have `npm` available.

To install Lightdash, run the following on your command line.

```shell
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

You _may_ need to install an additional package if you see any errors:

**Mac OS**


```shell
brew install unixodbc
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

**Ubuntu**

```shell
sudo apt install unixodbc
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

## Auto-generate `schema.yml` files

</a>

To make it faster to write and maintain your `schema.yml` files, the Lightdash CLI will automatically generate and 
sync your `schema.yml` files.

Inside your dbt project, open a terminal and run this command to generate the `schema.yml` file for a model called 
`mymodel`:

```shell
git commit # make sure to commit all your existing project first!
lightdash generate -s mymodel
```

This will create or update an existing `schema.yml` file to add any new columns that have appeared in the database. 

### Auto-sync `schema.yml` files after `dbt run` 

Since the `generate` command relies on your database schema to detect which columns are required, you'll often want
to run `dbt run` before running `generate`. You can combine `dbt run` and `lighdash generate` into one command which 
will run models and then regenerate the 
`schema.yml` files for any models than changed:

```shell
git commit
lightdash dbt run  # Run dbt AND re-sync schema.yml files
```

### Generating `schema.yml` for multiple models

`lightdash generate` supports dbt model selection syntax to generate files for a group of models:
```shell
lightdash generate # all models
lightdash generate -s payments  # just payments
lightdash generate -s payments+ # payments and all children
lightdash generate -s +payments # payments and all parents
lightdash generate -s +payments+ # payments and all children and parents
lightdash generate -s tag:prod # all models with the prod tag
lightdash generate -s payments customers # two specific models
lightdash generate -s payments+ +customers tag:prod # mix and match
```
