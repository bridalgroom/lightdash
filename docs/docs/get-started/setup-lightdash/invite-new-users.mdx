# Inviting teammates to your Lightdash project

You can only share things with people you've invited to your Lightdash project. Users with admin access to your project can invite users.

## Allowing users with certain email domain(s) to join automatically

Organization admins can add allowed email domains to their organization settings so that anyone with those email domains can automatically join their organization (without explicitly inviting them).

To update your organization's allowed email domains setting, just go to the `general` organization settings.

In the `allowed email domains` panel, enter the email domains you want to be able to automatically join your organization (e.g. here, we've added `lightdash.com`). Generic email domains like `google.com` or `hotmail.com` are not accepted.

You can then select the access that you want these users to have, by default. The organization admin can always update a user's permissions after they've joined the organization!

You have the option to select:

- **Organization Viewer**: users that join as an organization viewer will automatically have `viewer` access to all projects in the organization. If a new project is added to the organization after they join, they will also get access to this new project as a viewer, by default. 
- **Organization Member**: Users that join as an organization member will only have `viewer` access to the projects that you select. 

Once you've selected the default roles for your allowed email domains, make sure to click `update` to save your changes.

Now, when a user tries to join Lightdash, they will be prompted to join your workspace if they have one of your allowed email domains.

## Inviting new users individually

To invite your teammates individually, just click on `Settings` --> `User Management` --> `Add user`.

<img src={InviteUserAction} width="852" height="607" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

You then need to input the email address of the user you want to invite and select the role you want to assign them. You can read more about [user roles and permissions in Lightdash here](../../references/roles.mdx).

Once you hit `send invite`, we'll send an email to the new user with their invite link.

Once you're done inviting users, you can head back to the list of users in the `User Management` tab, scroll to the bottom and see all of the pending invitations for your project. You can also re-generate an invite link if you need to!
