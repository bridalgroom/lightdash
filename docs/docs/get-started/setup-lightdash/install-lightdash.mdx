# Install Lightdash

There are three ways you can install Lightdash:

1. If you want to use Lightdash but don't want to worry about self hosting, then you can check [how to set up Lightdash Cloud](#getting-set-up-on-lightdash-cloud)
2. If you want to deploy a production Lightdash instance on a cloud platform that supports docker images, then you can use [how to deploy Lightdash manually](#deploy-manually).
3. If you want to run Lightdash in your local machine (that means, you won't be able to share the things you build in
Lightdash with anyone else), then you can [get started with our installation script](#deploy-locally-with-our-installation-script).


----

## Getting set up on Lightdash Cloud

Want to have a production Lightdash instance, but not comfortable with self-hosting?

You can [**sign up to our waitlist for Lightdash Cloud**](https://hamzah905194.typeform.com/to/HFlicx4i)!

With Lightdash Cloud, you get a Lightdash instance that you can share all your insights with your team
and you don't have to worry about any of the setup for hosting the instance yourself. So, if you're not too sure about all of
this container, Heroku and cloud-platforms business, or you're just not interested in the overhead of hosting your BI yourself,
then [Lightdash Cloud](https://hamzah905194.typeform.com/to/HFlicx4i) might be a good option for you :)

----

## Deploy locally with our installation script

If you only want to run Lightdash in your local machine (that means, you won't be able to share the things you build in
 Lightdash with anyone else), then this is how we'd recommend you install it.

:::caution Production deployments

For production deployments check the [Deploy manually](#deploy-manually) instructions.

:::

:::info

This script is going to install docker and docker compose. If you want do use a docker alternative, see [Deploy manually](#deploy-manually) instructions.

:::

#### 1. Clone the Lightdash repository

Clone the Lightdash code to your local machine. This will create a new directory called `./lightdash` (the Lightdash directory).

```bash
# Clone the Lightdash repo
git clone https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash
cd lightdash
# A new directory called "lightdash" should appear
```

#### 2. Install & Launch Lightdash

:::info

If you're using a local dbt project, when you're asked `how you want to setup Lightdash`, select the option **"with local dbt"**
and during the project creation keep the **Project directory** value as **"/usr/app/dbt"**.

:::

```bash
./install.sh
# follow cli instructions
```

----

## Deploy to Heroku

Click to deploy the latest version of Lightdash to heroku. This provides a secure, production deployment.

#### 1. Once click deploy to Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash-deploy-heroku)

Note if you don't have an account, you'll be prompted to signup. It's free to deploy Lightdash!

#### 2. Launch Lightdash

Heroku will show that it's setting up and deploying Lightdash. When it's complete you should see an option to view
your Lightdash app.

#### 3. Setup your admin account and Lightdash project

As the first user for Lightdash, you'll be prompted to create an admin account to secure your instance. Then, you'll get started with creating your Lightdash project.
You can follow along with the instructions for setting up your Lightdash project here: #page to instructions for Lightdash project setup guide

## Deploy manually

This is the recommended way to install and run Lightdash in production.

### Using docker compose

Lightdash docker compose environment variables:

Name | Type | Default | Required | Description
---|---|---|---|---
**PGHOST** | string | *auto generated* | false | postgres hostname
**PGPORT** | number | 5432 | false | Postgres port

**PGPASSWORD** | string |  | true | Postgres password
**PGDATABASE** | string | postgres | false | Postgres database name
**SECURE_COOKIES** | boolean | false | false | Secure cookies
**TRUST_PROXY** | boolean | false | false | Trust the reverse proxy when setting secure cookies (via the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header)

**PORT** | number | 8080 | false | Port for Lightdash
**DBT_PROJECT_DIR** | string | . | false | Path to your local dbt project. Only set this value if you want to use a dbt project from the same machine


#### 1. Clone the Lightdash repository

Clone the Lightdash code to your local machine. This will create a new directory called `./lightdash` (the Lightdash directory).

```bash
# Clone the Lightdash repo
git clone https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash
cd lightdash
```

#### 2. Create containers

```bash
LIGHTDASH_SECRET="not very secret" PGPASSWORD="password" docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --detach --remove-orphans
```

### Using docker images

:::info

If you're using **podman** replace `docker` with `podman` in the commands mentioned.

:::

#### 1. Start a Postgres container

```bash
# Example data:
# Username: postgres
# Password: mysecretpassword
# Database name: postgres
# Port: 5432

docker run --name lightdash-db -p "5432:5432" \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
```

#### 2. Start Lightdash container

Lightdash environment variables:

Name | Type | Default | Required | Description
---|---|---|---|---
**PGHOST** | string |  | true | Postgres hostname
**PGPORT** | number |  | true | Postgres port
**PGUSER** | string |  | true | Postgres user

:::info

If you want to use a dbt project from the same machine, you will need to set a volume to **/usr/app/dbt**. Example:
`-v ~/my/dbt/path:/usr/app/dbt`

:::

```bash
# Example data:
# DB Host: 192.168.0.1
# DB Port: 5432
# DB Username: postgres
# DB Password: mysecretpassword
# DB name: postgres
# Lightdash secret: not very secret
# Lightdash port: 8080

docker run --name lightdash-app \
    -e PGHOST=192.168.0.1 -e PGPORT=5432 \
    -e PGUSER=postgres -e PGPASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
    -e PGDATABASE=postgres -e LIGHTDASH_SECRET="not very secret" \
    -p 8080:8080 \
    -d lightdash/lightdash:latest
```
