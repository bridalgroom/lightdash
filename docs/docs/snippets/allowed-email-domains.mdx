Organization admins can add allowed email domains to their organization settings so that anyone with those email domains can automatically join their organization (without explicitly inviting them).

To update your organization's allowed email domains setting, just go to the `general` organization settings.

In the `allowed email domains` panel, enter the email domains you want to be able to automatically join your organization (e.g. here, we've added `lightdash.com`). Generic email domains like `google.com` or `hotmail.com` are not accepted.

You can then select the access that you want these users to have, by default. The organization admin can always update a user's permissions after they've joined the organization!

You have the option to select:

- **Organization Viewer**: users that join as an organization viewer will automatically have `viewer` access to all projects in the organization. If a new project is added to the organization after they join, they will also get access to this new project as a viewer, by default.
- **Organization Member**: users that join as an organization member will only have access to the projects that you select with the role you select.

Once you've selected the default roles for your allowed email domains, make sure to click `update` to save your changes.

Now, when a user tries to join Lightdash, they will be prompted to join your workspace if they have one of your allowed email domains.

### Default project

In the organization settings you can set a default project. This is the project users will see when they log in for the
first time or from a new device. If a user does not have access, they will see their next accessible project.
