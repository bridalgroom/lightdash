# Adding and managing Tables in your Lightdash project

Tables are the things that you see in the `Tables` list when you open Lightdash. They're the foundation of your data exploration, the backbone to figuring out your unknowns, the art behind your charts...basically, they're pretty important.

So, we wanted to go through how to actually add these Tables to your Lightdash project, and once they're in there, how you can configure them to make the most of them. 

<img src={TablesView} width="1257" height="959" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

## How do I add tables to my Lightdash project? 

The beauty of Lightdash is that we're pretty well synced with your dbt project. So, in Lightdash, Tables actually come from dbt models that have been defined in your dbt project's `.yml` files.

If your dbt model has been defined in a .yml file, it will appear in Lightdash as a Table. 

:::info

Not sure what a .yml file is? Make sure to [check out dbt's docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/configs-and-properties) to learn more about building .yml files for your dbt project.

:::

For example, if we had a file called `projects.yml` in dbt that looked something like the one below, we'd see a Table called `Projects` in Lightdash.

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: projects
    columns: 
      - name: dashboards_created_num_total
      - name: days_since_project_created
```

<img src={ExampleTable} width="385" height="210" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

We recommend structuring your dbt project with one .yml file per model (or .sql file).

We've found that this makes it easier to navigate through your .yml files and easier to manage your dbt models, especially as your project becomes bigger. 

Here's an example of our dbt project at Lightdash too see what that looks like in practice:

- We have one .sql file per model (these are the files where all of our models' business logic sits)
- We have one .yml file per model (these are the files where all of your Tables' configuration sits)

<img src={dbtRepoExample} width="316" height="431" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

### But, in my dbt project, I have a single schema.yml file. Not one for each model. Will that still work?

Yep! We realize that schema files come in all shapes and sizes. 

Some people prefer to write the .yml files for all of their models in a single .yml file at the directory level, and that's totally fine - it will still work with Lightdash. 

But, like we said just above, if you're trying to decide how to setup your dbt project, **we'd recommend having one .yml file per model.**

### 1. Creating Tables and their dimensions in Lightdash using `lightdash dbt run`

:::info

These instructions assume that you've already installed the Lightdash CLI. If you haven't done that yet, then check out the docs on [Installing the Lightdash CLI](/guides/cli/how-to-install-the-lightdash-cli) before moving on!

:::

Dimensions are attributes of your data. They are directly linked to a column in a dbt model.

To explore data in Lightdash, you need to have dimensions defined in your Tables. Dimensions are created automatically when you define columns in your dbt model properties. 

For example, if we go back to our `projects.yml` file from above, we'd have a Table called `Projects` and it would have the dimensions: `Dashboards created num total` and `Days since project created`.

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: projects
    columns: 
      - name: dashboards_created_num_total
      - name: days_since_project_created
```

<img src={ExampleTable} width="385" height="210" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

:::info

Before you get started with the next steps, you might want to check out onto a new branch if you're working with a version controlled project!

:::

We've made it really easy to add new Tables to our Lightdash project using our CLI tool and the command:

```shell
lightdash dbt run
```

This command runs our dbt project to create our analysis-ready tables in our data warehouse. Then, it auto-generates our Lightdash configuration.

You have a few options with this command though:

#### 1. Generate Tables and dimensions for my **_entire_** dbt project 

**_You will only really need to do this when you're first setting up your Lightdash project._**

If you're joining a project with lots of Tables in it already, you probably don't need to run this - we'd suggest checking out option 2 below.

To run + generate tables for all of the models with `.yml` files, you just need to run the following on your command line:

```shell
lightdash dbt run
```

This command will run + generate tables for all of the models with `.yml` files. It will also generate dimensions for all of the columns in your dbt project. 

#### 2. Generate Tables and dimensions for **_some_** of the models in my dbt project

There may be a specific set of models that you want to generate Tables for in Lightdash. The `lightdash dbt run` command supports dbt model selection syntax to generate .yml files for a group of models. This means you can use tags, model names, or other model selection syntax to specify which models you want to generate dimensions for in your dbt project.

```shell
lightdash run # all models
lightdash run -s payments  # just payments
lightdash run -s payments+ # payments and all children
lightdash run -s +payments # payments and all parents
lightdash run -s +payments+ # payments and all children and parents
lightdash run -s tag:prod # all models with the prod tag
lightdash run -s payments customers # two specific models
lightdash run -s payments+ +customers tag:prod # mix and match
```

After running our dbt models, `lightdash dbt run` is going to auto-generate all the configuration that Lightdash needs to build our Tables. Hereâ€™s an example of an auto-generated `.yml` file for a table that you might see:

```yaml
# customers.yml
version: 2
models:
  - name: customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
				meta:
					dimension:
						type: string
      - name: name
				meta:
					dimension: 
						type: string
      - name: created_at
        meta:
          dimension:
						type: timestamp
```

The `customers.yml` file tells Lightdash about all the attributes of customers. So by now our Lightdash project usually looks a little like this:

```bash
lightdash-project
â”œâ”€â”€ dbt_project.yml
â””â”€â”€ models
    â”œâ”€â”€ customers.sql
    â””â”€â”€ customers.yml
```

Now letâ€™s push our Table to Lightdash so we can start exploring our data through the UI.

### 2. Make sure your changes are in production, then you're ready to go!

If you're working with a version controlled project, you'll just want to make sure to merge your changes into production (e.g. `main` or `master`) before you move onto the next steps. 

Once you've got the model .yml files where you want 'em, you're ready to move onto the next step of connecting your project.

## Configuring which Tables appear in Lightdash

Sometimes, there are models in our dbt project with .yml files that we might not want to appear in Lightdash (`base` tables, I'm looking at you ðŸ‘€). So, we've made it possible for you to configure which Tables you want to appear in Lightdash. 

To get to your Table Configuration settings, just:

1. Click `Settings` in the navigation bar
2. Click on `project management` in the sidebar
3. Click on the `Settings` button for the project's tables you want to configure
4. Once you're in your `Project settings`, click on the `Tables configuration` in the sidebar.

<img src={ProjectManagement} width="712" height="506" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>
<img src={TablesConfiguration} width="1525" height="782" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

Now that you're in the right place, let's get to the juicy stuff. You have three options for configuring the Tables that pop up in Lightdash:

<img src={PickTables} width="704" height="410" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

1. **Show entire project**: I hope this one isn't too much of a surprise. If you select this option, it shows _all_ of the models with .yml files in your dbt project in Lightdash.
2. **Show models with any of these tags**: This option depends on dbt tags. If you're not familiar with dbt tags, [we'd recommend checking them out](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/tags) (they're really handy for managing models!). If you already have a specific model tag (or tags) you want to limit Lightdash to using, this is where you can add them in. For example, all of our production models have the tag `prod`, so we've configured our Tables using that tag.
3. **Show models in this list**: If you're not keen on using tags then you can manually select the models you want to include as Tables in your Lightdash project using this option. 

:::info

ðŸ”¥ **Hot tip**: if you want to manage the models you're using in Lightdash **_in your dbt project_**, then you can use [dbt's tags](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/tags) to tag all of your models with `lightdash` then setup your Tables Configuration to limit tables with the tag `lightdash` (see option 2 above).

So, for the models you want to include in Lightdash, you'd just add the tag to your model's .yml file:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: model_name
    config:
      tags: ['lightdash']
...
```

Or, to your model's `.sql` file in the config block:

```yaml
{{ config(
    tags=["lightdash"]
) }}

select ...
```

Then, you'll set your Table Configuration:

<img src={LightdashTag} width="708" height="414" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

:::

### Showing hidden tables in Lightdash

You can still access + explore all of the Tables from your dbt project (with .yml files), even if you've filtered them from appearing in the sidebar. You can access these hidden table by just clicking on the `Show hidden tables` toggle in the Tables sidebar. 

<img src={ShowHiddenTables} width="460" height="227" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

## Changing your Table's labels, adding joins, and more!

Once you're happy with which Tables are showing up in Lightdash, you can add configurations to your Tables like:

- Changing how the Table name appears in Lightdash (using the `labels` config)
- [Joining your Table to other Tables](/guides/how-to-join-tables) (using the `joins` config)

All of these configurations and more are outlined in the [Tables reference doc here](/references/tables).

## Next up: adding metrics + exploring your Tables

Now that you have some of your Tables in Lightdash, it's time to enrich them with some metrics and learn how to explore them. 

We'd recommend checking out these docs next:
