# Adding Tables to your Lightdash project

Tables are the things that you see in the `Tables` list when you open Lightdash. They're the foundation of your data exploration, the backbone to figuring out your unknowns, the art behind your charts...basically, they're pretty important.

So, we wanted to go through how to actually add these Tables to your Lightdash project, and once they're in there, how you can configure them to make the most of them.

## How do I add tables to my Lightdash project? 

The beauty of Lightdash is that we're pretty well synced with your dbt project. So, in Lightdash, Tables actually come from dbt models that have been defined in your dbt project's `.yml` files.

If your dbt model has been defined in a .yml file, it will appear in Lightdash as a Table. 

:::info

Not sure what a .yml file is? Make sure to [check out dbt's docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/configs-and-properties) to learn more about building .yml files for your dbt project.

:::

For example, if we had a file called `users.yml` in dbt that looked something like the one below, we'd see a Table called `users` in Lightdash with the dimensions: `user_id`, `created_at_date`, and `first_purchase_date`.

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: users
    columns: 
      - name: user_id
      - name: created_at_date
      - name: first_purchase_date
```

We recommend structuring your dbt project with one .yml file per model (or .sql file).

We've found that this makes it easier to navigate through your .yml files and generally manage your dbt models, especially as your project becomes bigger. 

Here's an example of our dbt project at Lightdash too see what that looks like in practice:

- We have one .sql file per model (these are the files where all of our models' business logic sits)
- We have one .yml file per model (these are the files where all of your Tables' configuration sits)

### But, in my dbt project, I have a single schema.yml file. Not one for each model. Will that still work?

Yep! We realize that schema files come in all shapes and sizes. 

Some people prefer to write the .yml files for all of their models in a single .yml file at the directory level, and that's totally fine - it will still work with Lightdash. 

But, like we said just above, if you're trying to decide how to setup your dbt project, **we'd recommend having one .yml file per model.**

## How to create `.yml` files

There are a few ways to do this - some easier than others. 

### 1. The good old fashioned way: totally manually

You can create .yml files for your models by just creating a file in your dbt model's directory, then typing out all of the columns into it.

You'll need to make sure that your .yml file follows [the formatting rules for a dbt `model`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/configs-and-properties#example).

### 2. The much easier way: using a schema generator

If you've ever written a full .yml file manually, you won't be surprised that someone has gone ahead and automated the process. 

There are a couple of schema generators out there, but the one we've ended up using the most was the `dbt-invoke` package. You can read more about [how to install + use it here](https://pypi.org/project/dbt-invoke/).

## How to add Tables to Lightdash

Once you have your .yml files all ready to go and synced to the branch that your Lightdash project is connected to, you can just hit `refresh dbt` and your Tables should pop up in your project. (Not sure about how to sync dbt + Lightdash? [Check out our docs on it here](/references/syncing_your_dbt_changes).)

They'll be tucked away under `Explore` --> `Tables` in the navigation bar.

## Configuring which Tables appear in Lightdash

Sometimes, there are models in our dbt project with .yml files that we might not want to appear in Lightdash (`base` tables, I'm looking at you ðŸ‘€). So, we've made it possible for you to configure which Tables you want to appear in Lightdash. 

To get to your Table Configuration settings, just:

1. Click `Settings` in the navigation bar
2. Click on `project management` in the sidebar
3. Click on the `Settings` button for the project's tables you want to configure
4. Once you're in your `Project settings`, click on the `Tables configuration` in the sidebar.

<img src={ProjectManagement} width="712" height="506" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>
<img src={TablesConfiguration} width="1525" height="782" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

Now that you're in the right place, let's get to the juicy stuff. You have three options for configuring the Tables that pop up in Lightdash:

1. **Show entire project**: I hope this one isn't too much of a surprise. If you select this option, it shows _all_ of the models with .yml files in your dbt project in Lightdash.
2. **Show models with any of these tags**: This option depends on dbt tags. If you're not familiar with dbt tags, [we'd recommend checking them out](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/tags) (they're really handy for managing models!). If you already have a specific model tag (or tags) you want to limit Lightdash to using, this is where you can add them in. For example, all of our production models have the tag `prod`, so we've configured our Tables using that tag.
3. **Show models in this list**: If you're not keen on using tags then you can manually select the models you want to include as Tables in your Lightdash project using this option. 

<img src={PickTables} width="704" height="410" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

:::info

ðŸ”¥ **Hot tip**: if you want to manage the models you're using in Lightdash **_in your dbt project_**, then you can use [dbt's tags](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/tags) to tag all of your models with `lightdash` then setup your Tables Configuration to limit tables with the tag `lightdash` (see option 2 above).

So, for the models you want to include in Lightdash, you'd just add the tag to your model's .yml file:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: model_name
    config:
      tags: ['lightdash']
...
```

Or, to your model's `.sql` file in the config block:

```yaml
{{ config(
    tags=["lightdash"]
) }}

select ...
```

### Showing hidden tables in Lightdash

You can still access + explore all of the Tables from your dbt project (with .yml files), even if you've filtered them from appearing in the sidebar. You can access these hidden table by just clicking on the `Show hidden tables` toggle in the Tables sidebar. 

<img src={ShowHiddenTables} width="460" height="227" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

## Changing your Table's labels, adding joins, and more!

Once you're happy with which Tables are showing up in Lightdash, you can add configurations to your Tables like:

- Changing how the Table name appears in Lightdash (using the `labels` config)
- [Joining your Table to other Tables](/guides/how-to-join-tables) (using the `joins` config)

All of these configurations and more are outlined in the [Tables reference doc here](/references/tables).

## Next up: adding metrics + exploring your Tables

Now that you have some of your Tables in Lightdash, it's time to enrich them with some metrics and learn how to explore them. 

We'd recommend checking out these docs next:
