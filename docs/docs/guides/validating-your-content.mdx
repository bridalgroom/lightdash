# Validating your content

Broken content is useless content. So, we've built tools in Lightdash to help you validate your projects and make sure that all of your content is working as expected. 

In Lightdash, users with [admin or developer roles](../references/roles) can access a content validation dashboard from within the project settings. This dashboard gives you an overview of all of the broken content in your project and detailed information about what is causing the errors.

You can access the content validation dashboard by heading to `project settings`, then selecting the tab `validator`.

## How can I validate my content?

The content validator will run:

  - when a user hits `Refresh dbt` in the app
  - when the command `lightdash deploy` is run on the Lightdash CLI (you can read more about automatically deploying your changes using GitHub actions [here](https://docs.lightdash.com/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-deploy#automatically-deploy-your-changes-to-lightdash-using-a-github-action))
  - when you update your project settings and hit `Test and compile`.
  - when you hit `Run validation` directly inside the content validator dashboard

## What content is included in the validation? 

The validator will show you any errors caused by metrics or dimensions which no longer exist, have been renamed, or have invalid definitions. The validator does not show errors caused by invalid SQL at run time (e.g. incorrect SQL queries, division by 0, trying to perform numeric calculations on a string value type).

Here are some examples of errors that would appear in your content validator:

- Renaming a metric from `total_revenue` to `sum_revenue`. The old metric name is used in a chart, so it breaks the chart.
- Deleting a dimension `is_premium_user` which is referenced in a metric's custom SQL definition.
- Deleting a dimension `is_premium_user` which is used as a filter on a dashboard.

The content types included in the validator dashboard are:

- **Tables** - errors in tables are caused when dimensions or metrics that have been deleted or renamed but are still referenced in other places in the table.
- **Charts** - errors in charts are caused when the results table or filters reference a metric or dimension which no longer exists.
- **Dashboards** - errors in dashboards are caused when a chart is broken in the dashboard or a filter references a metric or dimension which no longer exists.
