# Scheduled deliveries

Scheduled deliveries let you send a dashboard, chart, and their results to people via email or Slack - even to people who don't have an account in your Lightdash instance.

If your Lightdash organization has email or [Slack](/guides/sharing-in-slack.mdx#adding-slack-to-your-organization-lightdash-cloud) set up, you can create or select an existing saved chart or dashboard, add a scheduled delivery to it, and tell Lightdash when you’d like the send out your update. You can set up as many scheduled deliveries to a saved chart or dashboard as you like, and if you make any changes to the content, Lightdash will update the scheduled deliveries the next time they’re sent.

## Enabling scheduled deliveries

To use scheduled deliveries, an organization admin needs to have set up Slack or email for your Lightdash instance. 

To set up Slack, see [setting up Slack]([Slack](/guides/sharing-in-slack.mdx#adding-slack-to-your-organization-lightdash-cloud)). If you're not on a self-hosted instance (e.g. Cloud or Enterprise), then your instance comes with an email server already set up, so you don't need to do anything. If you're on a self-hosted instance, see [setting up email](https://docs.lightdash.com/references/environmentVariables#:~:text=postgres%20environment%20variables-,SMTP%20environment%20variables,-This%20is%20a) to configure a Lightdash email client.
