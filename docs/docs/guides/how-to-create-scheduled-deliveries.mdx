# Scheduled deliveries

Scheduled deliveries let you send a dashboard, chart, and their results to people via email or Slack - even to people who don't have an account in your Lightdash instance.

If your Lightdash organization has email or [Slack](/guides/sharing-in-slack.mdx#adding-slack-to-your-organization-lightdash-cloud) set up, you can create or select an existing saved chart or dashboard, add a scheduled delivery to it, and tell Lightdash when you’d like the send out your update. You can set up as many scheduled deliveries to a saved chart or dashboard as you like, and if you make any changes to the content, Lightdash will update the scheduled deliveries the next time they’re sent.

## Enabling scheduled deliveries

To use scheduled deliveries, an organization admin needs to have set up Slack or email for your Lightdash instance. 

To set up Slack, see [setting up Slack](/guides/sharing-in-slack.mdx#adding-slack-to-your-organization-lightdash-cloud). If you're not on a self-hosted instance (e.g. Cloud or Enterprise), then your instance comes with an email server already set up, so you don't need to do anything. If you're on a self-hosted instance, see [setting up email](https://docs.lightdash.com/references/environmentVariables#:~:text=postgres%20environment%20variables-,SMTP%20environment%20variables,-This%20is%20a) to configure a Lightdash email client.

## Creating a scheduled delivery

Only users with [admin or edit access](/references/roles.md) can create scheduled deliveries. To create a scheduled delivery, click on the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of your chart or dashboard, then click on `scheduled deliveries`.

You'll get a modal that pops up and shows you the list of existing scheduled deliveries for your saved chart or dashboard, and gives you the option to `create new`.

If you click on `create new`, you'll be brought to a configuration screen for your new scheduled delivery.

## Scheduled delivery options

- **Name**: this is the name of your scheduled delivery. 
- **Frequency**: this is how often your scheduled delivery will be sent. You can make this hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or custom - each frequency has its own options. For example, with a monthly schedule, you set the day of the month and the time that you want your scheduled delivery to be sent. The custom frequency lets you write out your own custom Cron expression if you need something more specific than our standard options. All times for the scheduler are in UTC.
- **Send to**: here, you can pick if you want to send your scheduled delivery to Slack, email, or both. You can add as many Slack channels and email addresses as you'd like to here.

Once you've set up all of your delivery options, then you can click `create new` to create your new scheduled delivery.

## Editing and deleting your scheduled deliveries

To remove a scheduled delivery from a chart or dashboard, click on the three-dot-menu beside the scheduled delivery name. From there, you can choose to `edit` or `delete` the scheduled delivery.
