# Update to latest docker image

Docker images are cached by default. This behaviour provides many benefits but prevents you 
from getting the new features and bug fixes we regularly release.

You can get the latest release by pulling the latest docker image:
```shell
docker pull lightdash/lightdash
```

Once this is complete you can [run Lightdash](../get-started/setup-a-local-dbt-project.md) as usual.
