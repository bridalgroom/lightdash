# Interacting with your dashboards

## Viewing the underlying data for a point on a chart

You can click on any point on a chart and view the records which make up that data point.

For example, I can click on the page views bar in my chart and I'd see all of the rows in the underlying table that make up the 19,120 page views count.

I can then export this as a CSV or explore from this underlying data.

## Using a chart to filter your dashboard (a.k.a. cross-filtering)

When you click on the value in a chart (e.g. a point in your scatter plot), you can choose to filter on that value and update all of the other relevant charts in the dashboard. This type of chart-to-dashboard filtering is sometimes called `cross-filtering`.

### You can see which tiles had the filter applied by hovering over the `dashboard filter applied` text on your chart tile.

Once you've clicked on your filter, all of the tiles in your dashboard with the filter field will be filtered to the value you selected. 

You can see which tiles had the filter applied by hovering over the `dashboard filter applied` text on your chart tile.

### Your cross-filtering will not change the saved chart unless you're in `edit` mode

The filters you add using cross-filtering won't be saved unless you're in `edit` mode (i.e. you've clicked `edit` in your dashboard) and you save the filters you applied. 

Otherwise, you can cross-filter away without any worry that you'll be changing the chart for everyone else! ðŸ˜Š
