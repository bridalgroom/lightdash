# Embedding

Lightdash allow you to embed some of your dashboards using expirable URLs and tokens (embed URLs from now on).

## How to generate embed dashboards 

### Create an embed secret

First, you need to generate a secret per project. 
This secret is like a password that will help you encrypt the URLs so we know the access is valid. 

<img src={EmbedCreateSecret} width="668" height="466" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

You can regenerate this secret, people with an old URL will automatically lose access to any previously shared embed URL.


### Allowed dashboards 

Only selected dashboards can be accessed via embed URLs

<img src={EmbedAddDashboard} width="668" height="466" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

### Preview 

Under preview you can generate a one-off shareable embed URL for a single dashboard. 

<img src={EmbedPreview} width="668" height="466" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

Click on `preview` to see the embed content and click on `Generate & copy URL` to generate an embed URL for this dashboard  

### Developer flow and code snippet 

Although you can generate URLs directly from Lightdash with a long expiration 
it is recommended to generate your own JWT tokens in your backend with a short expiration using your `secret` 
to make sure people can't be using embed URLs outside your app. 

To make this easier to integrate, we included some code snippets you can copy and use in your app to generate a valid embed URL
