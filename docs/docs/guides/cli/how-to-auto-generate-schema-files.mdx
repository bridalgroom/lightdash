# How to autogenerate Lightdash-ready .yml files for your models

The beauty of Lightdash is that we're pretty well synced with your dbt project. So, in Lightdash, Tables actually come from dbt models that have been defined in your dbt project's `.yml` files.

If your dbt model has been defined in a .yml file, it will appear in Lightdash as a Table.

## Auto-generate `schema.yml` files

To make it faster to write and maintain your `schema.yml` files, the Lightdash CLI will automatically generate and 
sync your `schema.yml` files.

Inside your dbt project, open a terminal and run this command to generate the `schema.yml` file for a model called 
`mymodel`:

```shell
git commit # make sure to commit all your existing project first!
lightdash generate -s mymodel
```

This will create or update an existing `schema.yml` file to add any new columns that have appeared in the database. 

## Auto-sync `schema.yml` files after `dbt run` 

Since the `generate` command relies on your database schema to detect which columns are required, you'll often want
to run `dbt run` before running `generate`. You can combine `dbt run` and `lighdash generate` into one command which 
will run models and then regenerate the 
`schema.yml` files for any models than changed:

```shell
git commit
lightdash dbt run  # Run dbt AND re-sync schema.yml files
```

## Generating `schema.yml` for multiple models

`lightdash generate` supports dbt model selection syntax to generate files for a group of models:
```shell
lightdash generate # all models
lightdash generate -s payments  # just payments
lightdash generate -s payments+ # payments and all children
lightdash generate -s +payments # payments and all parents
lightdash generate -s +payments+ # payments and all children and parents
lightdash generate -s tag:prod # all models with the prod tag
lightdash generate -s payments customers # two specific models
lightdash generate -s payments+ +customers tag:prod # mix and match
```
