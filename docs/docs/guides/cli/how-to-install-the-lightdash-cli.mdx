# How to install the Lightdash CLI

The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your dbt + Lightdash project. It makes development faster and
easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash instance.

To install the Lightdash CLI, run the following on your command line.

```shell
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

## Installing ODBC dependency

If you see any errors installing Lightdash CLI, you might need to install an extra package called `unixodbc`:

### Installing unixodbc on Ubuntu/Debian

```
sudo apt-get install unixodbc unixodbc-dev
```

### Installing unixodbc on RedHat/CentOS

```
sudo yum install unixODBC unixODBC-devel
```

### Installing unixodbc on OSX 

If you  are using `macports.org` you can install unixODBC by doing: 

```
sudo port unixODBC
```

If you are using `brew` you can install unixODBC by doing: 

```
brew install unixODBC
```

If you don't have brew, you can install brew by doing: 

```
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Installing unixodbc on FreeBSD 

```
cd /usr/ports/databases/unixODBC; make install
```

### Installing unixodbc on IBM 

```
i yum install unixODBC unixODBC-devel
```

Then you can install Lightdash CLI again `npm install -g @lightdash/cli`

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/odbc for more details.
