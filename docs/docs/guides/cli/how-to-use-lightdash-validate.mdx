# Lightdash Validate

You can check to see if your changes break any of the content in your project using `lightdash validate`. This command will run the validator which will return a list of content in your project that is broken and details about the errors. 

You can trigger a validation on a project using the Lightdash CLI so you can check locally if your changes will break anything. You can also add `lightdash validate` to your [GitHub Actions](#configure-github-actions) so changes can't be merged unless they pass the validation. 

## Usage 

![CLI validate](./assets/cli-validate.png)

### Validate your changes against your project by running lightdash validate

You can run `lightdash validate` to check if your changes break any of the content in production. 
By default, `lightdash validate` will check your changes against the content in the project you've selected on the CLI.
You can change your project using `lightdash config set-project`.

```
lightdash validate 
```

You will get a list of errors if your local files are going to break some content on your project.
These errors will not be reflected on the validation table on Lightdash settings.

### Validate any project using the project UUID

You can run a validation on any project by specifying the project UUID in the `lightdash validate` command.

```
lightdash validate --project <project uuid> 
``` 

**Note:** you can get your project UUID from the Lightdash URL by selecting the ID after the `projects/`

<img src={ProjectId} width="518" height="30" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>


## Configure Github actions  

This command will return an error (return code 1) if there is at least 1 validation error on your project. 
You can use this output to block a deploy on Github actions like this 

```
- name: Start preview 
  run: lightdash start-preview 
- name: Validate 
  run: lightdash validate --project ${{ steps.start-preview.outputs.project_uuid }}
```
