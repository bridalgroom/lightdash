# Lightdash Validate

You can trigger a validation on a project from the CLI, this will allow you to block a release (using Github actions) 
if a table/chart/dashboard is broken on a [preview environment](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview). 

Preview environments will copy all spaces/charts/dashboards into your new preview environment. 
This is only copied on preview creation, you can't sync the content afterwards. 

## Usage 

```
# This will trigger a validation for the last preview project you create using `lightdash start-preview`
lightdash validate 
```

or 

```
# Trigger validation for any project UUID 
lightdash validate --project <project uuid> 
```

## Configure Github actions  

This command will return an error (return code 1) if there is at least 1 validation error on your project. 
You can use this output to block a deploy on Github actions like this 

```
- name: Start preview 
  run: lightdash start-preview 
- name: Validate 
  run: lightdash validate 
```
