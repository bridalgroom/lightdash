# Lightdash Validate

You can check to see if your changes break any of the content in your project using `lightdash validate`. This command will run the validator which will return a list of content in your project that is broken and details about the errors. 

You can trigger a validation on a project using the Lightdash CLI so you can check locally if your changes will break anything. You can also add `lightdash validate` to your [GitHub Actions](#configure-github-actions) so changes can't be merged unless they pass the validation. 
if a table/chart/dashboard is broken on a [preview environment](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview). 

Preview environments will copy all spaces/charts/dashboards into your new preview environment. 
This is only copied on preview creation, you can't sync the content afterwards. 

## Usage 

![CLI validate](./assets/cli-validate.png)

### Validate your most recently created preview environment

If you just created a preview environment and you want to validate it, you can run `lightdash validate` to check its content. To learn more about using preview environments, [check out the docs here](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview).

```
lightdash validate 
```

### Validate any project using the project UUID

You can run a validation on any project by specifying the project UUID in the `lightdash validate` command.

```
lightdash validate --project <project uuid> 
``` 

**Note:** you can get your project UUID from the Lightdash URL by selecting the ID after the `projects/`

<img src={ProjectId} width="518" height="30" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>


## Configure Github actions  

This command will return an error (return code 1) if there is at least 1 validation error on your project. 
You can use this output to block a deploy on Github actions like this 

```
- name: Start preview 
  run: lightdash start-preview 
- name: Validate 
  run: lightdash validate 
```
