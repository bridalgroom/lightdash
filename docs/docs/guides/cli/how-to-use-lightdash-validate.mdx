# Lightdash Validate

You can check to see if your changes break any of the content in your project using `lightdash validate`. This command will run the validator which will return a list of content in your project that is broken and details about the errors. 

You can trigger a validation on a project using the Lightdash CLI so you can check locally if your changes will break anything. You can also add `lightdash validate` to your [GitHub Actions](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-validate.mdx/configure-github-actions) so changes can't be merged unless they pass the validation. 
if a table/chart/dashboard is broken on a [preview environment](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-preview). 

Preview environments will copy all spaces/charts/dashboards into your new preview environment. 
This is only copied on preview creation, you can't sync the content afterwards. 

## Usage 

```
# This will trigger a validation for the last preview project you create using `lightdash start-preview`
lightdash validate 
```

or 

```
# Trigger validation for any project UUID 
lightdash validate --project <project uuid> 
```

## Configure Github actions  

This command will return an error (return code 1) if there is at least 1 validation error on your project. 
You can use this output to block a deploy on Github actions like this 

```
- name: Start preview 
  run: lightdash start-preview 
- name: Validate 
  run: lightdash validate 
```
