# Lightdash Preview

**Developer previews** are temporary Lightdash projects where you can safely experiment with your metrics, dimensions and charts 
without affecting your production project.

### Run `lightdash preview` from inside your project

```shell
lightdash preview
```

Then `cmd` + `click` to open the preview link from your terminal. Once you're in Lightdash go to `Explore` --> `Tables`, then click on the model(s) you just updated to see your changes and play around with them.

**Problems with credentials?**

When you create developer previews, Lightdash will use the same warehouse connection settings you have in your 
`profiles.yml` file for your current dbt project. This can be a problem if you're using a local database that your 
laptop can reach but your Lightdash instance cannot.


## Set up developer previews on your pull requests

If you've connected Lightdash to GitHub, you can setup a `github action` and get Lightdash to create new dynamic `preview` projects automatically 
when a new `pull request` is created, and it will automatically delete the `preview` project when the `pull request` is closed or merged. 

### Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets

We are going to add some secrets and config to GitHub actions, 
but you don't want those to be public , so the best way to do this is to add them as secrets on Github

Go to your repo, click on `Settings` , on the left sidebar, click on `Secrets` under `Security`. 
Now click on the `New repository secret`

  <img src={GithubSecrets} width="940" height="681" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

We need the following credentials, you can find them on the app, 
or in your `~/.config/lightdash/config.yaml` file on your machine if you have used the Lightdash CLI already.

#### `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`

Create a new personal access token, by going to `Settings` > `Personal Access Tokens`. This is the token you'll put in for `LIGHTDASH_API_KEY`.  

  <img src={PersonalAccessToken} width="1304" height="517" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

#### `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`
The UUID for your project. For example, if your URL looks like `https://eu1.lightdash.cloud/projects/3538ab33-dc90-aabb-bc00-e50bba3a5f69/tables`, then `3538ab33-dc90-45f0-aabb-e50bba3a5f69` is your `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT`  

#### `LIGHTDASH_URL`

This is either `https://eu1.lightdash.cloud` or `https://app.lightdash.cloud` (check the URL to your Lightdash project)

#### `DBT_PROFILES`

Copy your full profiles.yml file into this secret, like:

```
jaffle_shop:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: abcd
      user: test
      password: ****
      role: SYSADMIN
      database: database
      warehouse: warehouse
      schema: jaffle_shop
```


### Step 2: Create start-preview.yml and close-preview.yml workflows in Github

Go to your repo, click on `Actions` menu, and click on `Configure`

![Github actions page](./assets/github-actions.png)

Now copy [this start-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/start-preview.yml) from our [cli-actions](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions) repo 

And save by clicking on `Start commit`

Do the same with [this close-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/close-preview.yml).

### You're done! 

Everytime you create a new `pull request` , a new `preview` project with your `branch` name will be created on your organization.
Everytime you make a change to that branch, the preview environment will get updated. 
Once you close or merge your `pull request`, the `preview` project will get deleted. 

You can see the log on `Github actions` page
