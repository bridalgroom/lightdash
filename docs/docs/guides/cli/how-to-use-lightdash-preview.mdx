# Testing your changes using Lightdash Preview

**Developer previews** are temporary Lightdash projects where you can safely experiment with your metrics and charts 
without affecting your production project.

### Run `lightdash preview` from inside your project

```shell
lightdash preview
```

Then `cmd` + `click` to open the preview link from your terminal. Once you're in Lightdash go to `Explore` --> `Tables`, then click on the model(s) you just updated to see your changes and play around with them.

**Problems with credentials?**

When you create developer previews, Lightdash will use the same warehouse connection settings you have in your 
`profiles.yml` file for your current dbt project. This can be a problem if you're using a local database that your 
laptop can reach but your Lightdash instance cannot.
