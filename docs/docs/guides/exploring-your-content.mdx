# Exploring your content

## Browsing the saved charts and dashboards in your project

The easiest way to get started in Lightdash is to check out the saved charts and dashboards that your team's already made. You can see a list of some of this content on your homepage as soon as you land in Lightdash. 

<img src={HomePage} width="790" height="593" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

You can always get back to your homepage by clicking on the Lightdash icon in the top-left corner of your screen.

<img src={HomeButton} width="416" height="113" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

You can also browse the lists of all of the saved charts, dashboards, and Spaces that you and your teammates have made in your project by clicking on `Browse` in your navbar.
