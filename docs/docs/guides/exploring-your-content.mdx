# Exploring your content

## Browsing the saved charts and dashboards in your project

The easiest way to get started in Lightdash is to check out the saved charts and dashboards that your team's already made. You can see a list of some of this content on your homepage as soon as you land in Lightdash. 

<img src={HomePage} width="790" height="593" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

You can always get back to your homepage by clicking on the Lightdash icon in the top-left corner of your screen.

<img src={HomeButton} width="416" height="113" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

You can also browse the lists of all of the saved charts, dashboards, and Spaces that you and your teammates have made in your project by clicking on `Browse` in your navbar. 

<img src={BrowseButton} width="412" height="241" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

## Using the search bar

If you already know what you're looking for, then you can use the search bar to search through all of the content in your Lightdash project. Just click on `search` in the navbar, or click `cmd + K` to open the search bar.

<img src={SearchBar} width="980" height="260" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

This global search matches content from everywhere in the project: dashboard names, field descriptions, table names, saved chart descriptions, etc.

## Exploring data in a dashboard

Dashboards allow you to arrange multiple charts that are related to each other into a single view. 

You can interact with dashboards in your project in a few different ways. [Learn more about it here](/guides/interactice-dashboards.mdx).
