## üìù Table calculation SQL templates

I'm not sure about you, but I definitely rely on copy-pasting old SQL code to write 90% of my new SQL queries. So, we thought it might be useful to give you some snippets of SQL code to help you get started with your most common table calculations.

- [Percent change from previous](percent-change-from-previous.mdx)
- [Percent of previous value](percent-of-previous-value.mdx)
- [Percent of total column](percent-of-total-column.mdx)
- [Rank in column](rank-in-column.mdx)
- [Running total](running-total.mdx)
