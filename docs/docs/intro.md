# Lightdash

Connect Lightdash to your dbt project, add metrics directly in your data transformation layer, then create and share your insights with your team.

Our mission is simple: we want to enable everybody in your company to answer their own questions using data.

## Check out Lightdash in action

1. [Check out the example project](http://demo.lightdash.com/) where you can click around and see Lightdash in action - no installation required!
2. Demos are fun and all, but to get the full Lightdash experience, we recommend working through our [install guide](get-started/setup-lightdash/install-lightdash.mdx) and hooking it up to your own project ðŸ˜Š

## See what we have planned in our Product Roadmap
Weâ€™re sharing [our product roadmap](https://lightdash.notion.site/Product-Roadmap-49e980c97bb44aa5a78ee2618851f11f) because we want to give you an idea of where weâ€™ll be in the next 3-6 months. We also want to hear if you think anything is missing.

You can add suggestions for a feature or functionality by [creating a new issue in our GitHub repo](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash/issues/new/choose). If we spot something that we think is a new milestone for the near future, weâ€™ll pull it into the product roadmap ðŸ‘Œ
