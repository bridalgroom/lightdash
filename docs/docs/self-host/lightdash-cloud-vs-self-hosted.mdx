# Lightdash Cloud vs. Self-Hosted

Lightdash is open-source and licensed under the MIT license. This means that you are free to self-host Lightdash on 
your own infrastructure but without any warranty or support from the Lightdash team. In other words, it's up to you 
to maintain and monitor your Lightdash instance.

If you're unsure whether to self-host or use Lightdash Cloud, here are some things to consider:

## When to use Lightdash Cloud

Unless you have a specific need to self-host, we recommend using Lightdash Cloud:

- Get started with Lightdash quickly
- No need to worry about maintaining your own infrastructure.
- Always have the latest version of Lightdash.
- Incredible support from the core Lightdash team and maintainers.

## When to self-host

There are a few reasons why you might want to self-host Lightdash:

- You're a large enterprise and want to run a proof-of-concept on your own infrastructure. This can be a great way 
  to get your hands on Lightdash, while your infosec team approves the use of Lightdash Cloud.
- Your data warehouse is on-premise and you cannot connect to it from the internet.
- You want to customise Lightdash to your specific needs.
