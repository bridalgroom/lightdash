# Configure Lightdash to use an external database

In production, we recommend using a managed database service (depending on your cloud provider). This ensures that your database is highly available and secure. You can also use a self-hosted database, but you will need to manage the database yourself.

The following configuration shows an example of how to configure Lightdash to use an external database. You can use this as a starting point for your own configuration.

## Configuration options for external database

```yaml
# values.yaml

# Disable the internal database
postgresql:
  enabled: false

# Configure Lightdash to use an external database
externalDatabase:
  host: lightdash-db.mycompany.com
  port: 5432
  user: lightdash
  password: lightdash
  database: lightdash
```

Optionally you can pass any of the [PostgreSQL Environment Variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html) to the `configMap`
