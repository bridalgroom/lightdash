### Description: What is it?

<!-- 
This should be short and sweet 🍬
How would you explain this feature in two lines to someone else at Lightdash?
-->

### Problem: What problem does this solve?

<!-- 
Describe the problem that this feature requests solves (or potential opportunity we're looking at).
Add a clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]
-->

### (Optional) Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?

<!--
Why are we solving this?
If you're a Lightdash user suggesting a feature, you can skip this! 
Otherwise, add any links to customer conversations or research. 
-->

### What: Roughly, what does this look like in the product?

<!-- 
Don't actually design a solution here. Try to use words or simple sketched pictures. Talk more about how this would interact with other parts of the product than how it should look. 
-->

<!-- 
### Notes on this template:

- Do not add the solution here. This proposal is meant to ***inform*** the solution.
- A proposal should fit on a printed A4 page. If it doesn't, you might want to keep working on it until you have a clearer view of the problem 🙂
- Use plain English. Try to avoid acronyms or technical words. Describe the problem like you would in a conversation with someone in the team.
