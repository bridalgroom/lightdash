### **Description: What is it?**

*This should be short and sweet üç¨*
*How would you explain this feature in two lines to someone else at Lightdash?*

...

### **Success: How will we know if we‚Äôve solved this problem?**

*Add how we will determine whether the problem has being solved. Qualitative and
quantitative measures.*

### **Audience: Who are we building this for?**

*Add example user descriptions that would benefit from this solution (e.g. users who are onboarding, data consumers, data builders). It's unlikely that a solution is for everyone* üôÇ

### **What: Roughly, what does this look like in the product?**

*Don't actually design a solution here. Try to use words or simple sketched pictures. Talk more about how this would interact with other parts of the product than how it should look.*

...

### **(Optional) How: What is the experiment/release plan?**

*Once high level product design is figured out, add the release plan below and include what is in scope + out of scope.*

### Notes on this template:

- Do not add the solution here. This proposal is meant to ***inform*** the solution.
- A proposal should fit on a printed A4 page. If it doesn't, you might want to keep working on it until you have a clearer view of the problem üôÇ
- Use plain English. Try to avoid acronyms or technical words. Describe the problem like you would in a conversation with someone in the team.
